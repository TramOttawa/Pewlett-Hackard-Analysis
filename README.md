# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of analysis

The goal of this project was to assist Bobby to determine who will be retiring in the next few years and how many positions will Pewlett Hackard need to fill. By doing this, I helped to generate a list of all employees eligible for the retirement package and a list of how many job titles are going to be filled after that generation of employees retires.

## Software:
* SQL
* PostgreSQL
* pgAdmin4

## Results

* After creating the unique_titles table, there are 90,398 employees retiring.

* The details are as follows:

* The mentorship_eligibility table was created by joining the employees, department employees, and titles tables. 

* There were 1,940 employees eligible to participate in a memtorship program.

## Summary

As the "silver tsunami" begins with Pewlett-Hackard, there are two main impacts as follows:

1) 90,398 roles are in urgent need to be filled out as soon as the workforce starts retiring at any given time.

2) There are not enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. We have only 1,940 employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. With this situation, PH company should set up good strategies to fill in the vacant positions in the near future and start to have programs to train the mentors as soon as possible.
